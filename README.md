# Sage-Meet-In-The-Middle-Attack
**The goal of this program is to make use of Meet In The Middle Attack(MITM) to figure out the Key pair used in a double S-AES
encryption.**
The following five plaintext messages were encrypted by double S-AES using two different keys. 
Given their corresponding ciphertext messages,
we utilize the MITM attack technique to figure out the key pairs used for the encryption.
